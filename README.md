- Select "Chrome" as the device

#### Desktop Development

**Linux:**
```bash
flutter run -d linux
```

**macOS:**
```bash
flutter run -d macos
```

**Windows:**

flutter run -d windows
```

### Development Proxy for CORS Issues

When developing locally and connecting to a backend API, you may encounter CORS issues. Use the development proxy to bypass these:

1. **Configure the Proxy** (if proxy file exists in your project)
   - Update the proxy configuration with your server IP address
   - Example: Change `serverIp` to your backend server IP

2. **Run the Proxy**
   ```bash
   dart run tools/proxy.dart
   ```
   *(Note: Create a proxy.dart file as needed based on Worksheet 7g instructions)*

3. **Run Your Flutter App**
   ```bash
   flutter run -d chrome
   ```

### Hot Reload and Hot Restart

While the app is running:
- **Hot Reload**: Press `r` in terminal (or save file in VS Code)
- **Hot Restart**: Press `R` in terminal
- **Quit**: Press `q` in terminal

## 🌐 Deployment

### Web Deployment to Apache Server

1. **Build the Application**
   ```bash
   flutter build web --release
   ```

2. **Locate Build Files**
   - All files are in: `build/web/`

3. **Deploy to Server**
   
   **Option A: Using FileZilla (GUI)**
   ```
   a. Install FileZilla Client
   b. Connect to your server via SFTP
      - Host: Your server IP (e.g., 192.168.1.100)
      - Username: Your server username
      - Password: Your server password
      - Port: 22 (for SFTP)
   c. Navigate to local: build/web/
   d. Navigate to remote: /var/www/html/
   e. Upload all files and folders from build/web/ to /var/www/html/
   ```

   **Option B: Using SCP (Command Line)**
   ```bash
   scp -r build/web/* username@server-ip:/var/www/html/
   ```

4. **Test Deployment**
   - Open browser
   - Navigate to: `http://your-server-ip/`
   - The e-library application should load

### Desktop Application Deployment

For desktop platforms, distribute the build output directory:
- **Linux**: Share the entire `build/linux/x64/release/bundle/` folder
- **macOS**: Share the `.app` file from `build/macos/Build/Products/Release/`
- **Windows**: Share the entire `build/windows/x64/runner/Release/` folder

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Issue: "flutter: command not found"
**Solution:**
- Verify Flutter is in your PATH
- Restart terminal/command prompt after adding to PATH
- Windows: Reboot may be required after PATH changes

#### Issue: "Flutter Doctor shows errors"
**Solution:**
- Run: `flutter doctor -v` to see detailed errors
- Install missing dependencies as indicated
- Android licenses (if needed): `flutter doctor --android-licenses`

#### Issue: CORS errors when connecting to backend API
**Solution:**
- Use the development proxy (see Development Guide)
- Configure backend server to allow CORS headers
- For production, deploy to same domain as backend

#### Issue: Build fails with "no connected devices"
**Solution:**
- For web: Install Chrome or use `flutter run -d web-server`
- For desktop: Enable desktop support:
  ```bash
  flutter config --enable-windows-desktop  # Windows
  flutter config --enable-macos-desktop    # macOS
  flutter config --enable-linux-desktop    # Linux
  ```

#### Issue: Linux build fails with missing libraries
**Solution:**
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y clang cmake ninja-build pkg-config libgtk-3-dev liblzma-dev
```

#### Issue: macOS build fails with Xcode errors
**Solution:**
- Install latest Xcode from App Store
- Run: `sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer`
- Accept license: `sudo xcodebuild -license accept`

#### Issue: Windows build fails with Visual Studio errors
**Solution:**
- Install Visual Studio 2022 with "Desktop development with C++" workload
- Ensure Flutter can find Visual Studio:
  ```cmd
  flutter doctor -v
  ```
